# Loan Approval Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application should be approved based on a set of applicant details.

### Dataset

The project uses the "Loan Prediction Problem Dataset" from Kaggle. The `Loan_Train.csv` file contains historical data on applicants.

### Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Seaborn & Matplotlib

### How to Run

1.  Make sure you have all the libraries from the tech stack installed.
2.  Open the `loan_predictor.ipynb` notebook in a compatible environment like VS Code or Jupyter Notebook.
3.  Run the cells from top to bottom. The notebook handles data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.
